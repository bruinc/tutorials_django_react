# models = database layout
# A model is the single, definitive source of truth about your data. It contains the essential fields 
# and behaviors of the data youâ€™re storing. Django follows the DRY Principle. The goal is to define 
# your data model in one place and automatically derive things from it.

# DRY = Don't repeat yourself.
# Every distinct concept and/or piece of data should live in one, and only one, place. Redundancy is 
# bad. Normalization is good.
# The framework, within reason, should deduce as much as possible from as little as possible.

# This includes the migrations - unlike in Ruby On Rails, for example, migrations are entirely derived 
# from your models file, and are essentially a history that Django can roll through to update your 
# database schema to match your current models.
